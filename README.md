# CodeVulnerabilityML

Code vulnerability creates potential risks of compromising the software security, allowing hackers to take advantage of the code by attaching an endpoint to extract data or tampering the software. 

While state-of-the-art approaches primarily focus either on data-driven or rule-based models, this paper tends to learn security vulnerabilities in a software source code more accurately through partnership of data-driven learning (deep learning) and a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning process. The reason is to compensate for weaknesses of each learning method by alleviating the strengths of the other one. For instance, data-driven models are more expressive, but rule-based models formulate intuitive facts in the form of predetermined rules. Moreover, rule-based models are not sufficiently representative of data and are static, while data-driven models are yet unable to discover fully generalizable patterns within data but are enabled to dynamically learn.

The proposed hybrid approach, initially train a recurrent neural network (RNN), which encodes the source code into distributed continuous vectors, while preserving semantic-syntactic properties of the code. 

Given the embedding vectors, later a set of rules are governed by an ensemble classification method, namely random forest, which combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach an optimal classification accuracy. Finally, the least contributing trees to the final classification decisions are identified through a novel clustering algorithm, which groups the decision trees according to their features importance and remove the invaluable groups. This pruning step improves the quality of the remaining forest through preventing the model to become overfitted to the training data. 

We compared our method to several state-of-the-art rule-based, NN-based, pruning-based, and vulnerability detection methods in two languages of Java and C. The evaluation results showed that the proposed approach surpasses all the said algorithms in the accuracy of classifying code-based vulnerabilities.
